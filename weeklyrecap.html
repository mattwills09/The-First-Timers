            Annnnnnnnnnddddddddd.. WE'RE BACK!  Praise the Lawd above.  We almost didn't make it without football there.  But all in all I guess it's ok on my end here, I do enjoy cuddling with the belt every night.. Kendall doesn't enjoy it so much.<p></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            And yes, I do know the Week 2 games are going on right now, but we should at least have an update on what went on in Week 1.  So ON TO THE draft and the GAMES (and what people actually want to hear about), the draft was a smashing success, with the outside help given from the peanut gallery, and the stately owner's box where picks were thrown down to the peasants like mannah from heaven.  Can you believe we're already through Week 1!?  Tough I know, but we'll hold onto this year's season like the last few weeks of summer that seem to be slipping by.  But.. enough of all that sappy stuff, let's get into these scores and recaps!<p></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Starting at the top (and by that I mean last year's winner.. cough.. cough..), ahem, the newly formed <b>Shrek and Donkey (1-0)</b>, who took over for the Legion of Groom which has graduated to a full Groom, added a furry child, and almost a Father to a full-flegded human at this point, started the season with a win against last season's 11th place team <b>NoBogies Gene (0-1)</b> in a close affair.  NoBogies must have been feeling gracious (which I appreciate), because it was pointed out that they didn't start a defense this week, even the Ravens D against the community college level Dolphins!  Shrek and Donkey did enjoy that.. but let's get these things wrapped up and under control here NoBogies for Week 2, okay?  Shrek and Donkey (1-0) will face off in a "friendly" family battle vs. <b>Momma Dubs (1-0)</b> this week, while NoBogies Gene (0-1) will look to get back on track against their doppelganger rivals, <b>Uncle Rico's (0-1)</b> this week.  Next in line to recap are the perennial <b>Carlisle Crazies (1-0)</b>, coming off an almost a back-to-back championship, who started the season strong holding off a surging <b>Harrisburg Neutrinos (0-1)</b> for a close two-point win.  Drew Brees was just shy of bringing the Neutrinos (0-1) back for a miracle comeback, to the Neutrinos chagrin.  The Crazies look to keep their winning ways going this week facing off against <b>Team Lundy (0-1)</b> in another "friendly" family battle, while the Neutrinos (0-1) will look to get back to .500 in a 'DAD BATTLE' vs. <b>Captain Inapprpriate (1-0)</b>.<p></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Last year's 3rd place finisher, <b>Team Lundy (0-1)</b>, stumbled a bit out of the blocks, losing to the always strong <b>AndiRoos! (1-0)</b>, and will have a tough test against the Carlisle Crazies (1-0) this weekend, while the AndiRoos! (1-0) will look to keep rolling facing off against the <b>Couch Coach (1-0)</b>.  After a strong season last year and finishing in 4th place, the ever improving Almost Williams.. wait scratch that.. <b>Almost Mama! (1-0)</b> had a very exciting comeback win this past weekend over the aforementioned Couch Coach (0-1), and will have a tough matchup this weekend playing the <b>Madi Moose (0-1)</b>, who will be looking to get back to their winning ways.  Heading right on down the standings, <b>Captain Inappropriate (1-0)</b> started the season strong with a big win over the <b>Uncle Rico's (0-1)</b>, and has a tough test in store, and another DAD BATTLE, versus the <b>Harrisburg Neutrinos (0-1)</b>, who are definitely looking for a win this week.  The <b>Uncle Rico's (0-1)</b> may be suffering from a sophomore slump out of the college scene, rolling to a first week loss this past weekend against Captain Inappropriate (1-0), but I have no doubt they'll be back on track and have their game faces on this coming weekend squaring off with NoBogies Gene (0-1).<p></p>
                
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The always improving season-by-season <b>Momma Dubs (1-0)</b> had a slightly underwhelming season last year finishing 7th, but started the season strong with a comeback win over the <b>Madi Moose (0-1)</b>, and will look to keep the win train rolling this weekend against <b>Shrek and Donkey! (0-1)</b>, or mayyybe she'll have a little soft spot in her heart for her youngest child and maybe give Ben a rest this week (which he definitely needs after last week).  But I'm guessing no, because you absolutely don't want to get <b>Momma Dubs (1-0)</b> mad.. this I know from experience.  <b>Madi Moose (0-1)</b> will look to get back on track in an <em>(almost)</em> <b><em>MOM BATTLE</em></b> this weekend taking on <b>Almost Mama! (1-0)</b>.<p></p>

            Well that's it for Week 1, let's hope everyone has good luck for these afternoon games and I gotta say it.. <b>IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK!</b><p></p>

            Have a great rest of your weekend and just an fyi also, we have an in-progress website for our league where all these recaps will be getting posted then.  The site for the league is here:  The First Timers Fantasy Football League Website, and feel free to forward over any suggestions!<p></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Hello.. hello.. hello.. whew Week 2 already!?  That was quick.<p></p>

            So this fantasy season as well as the NFL season are starting to take a little bit more shape here, and optimism is still flourishing in most parts of the country, like the last few warm flashes of summer before it gets cool again.. except for the Miami Dolphins that is.. and maybe (sadly) Steelers fans too.  Alas, and on to happier things, let's get into the recap:<p></p>

            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aD4kZn5k0SEvPmo/giphy.gif" style="margin:auto; display:block;">
            <p></p>

            For this week, we're going to start at the bottom and work our way up, and starting with <b>Team Lundy (0-2)</b>, who is off to an uncharacteristically slow start I must say, lost a heartbreaker this past weekend to their own flesh and blood in a HUUUGE Family Rivalry.  The <b>Carlisle Crazies (2-0)</b> got their second win of the season by <em>just 5 points</em>!  Couldn't even be nice to your dear, old Dad.. but such is life.  <b>Team Lundy (0-2)</b> will look to right the ship coming up, and will have a tough test against the <b>Couch Coach (1-1)</b>, who is coming off of their own win last weekend against the <b>AndiRoos!! (1-1)</b>.  Meanwhile, the aforementioned Crazies (2-0) will look to make it a perfect 3-0 this week, facing off against the strong playing <b>Captain Inappropriate (2-0)</b>.  The Captain also squeezed out a second win of the season last Sunday, beating the <b>Harrisburg Neutrinos (0-2)</b> by <em>less than 4</em> points.  The Neutrinos (0-2) are also unfortunately in the same slow-starting boat as <b>Team Lundy (0-2)</b>, but I'm sure they'll turn the season around here.  It will either be the Neutrinos (0-2) or the <b>NoBogies Gene (0-2)</b> who will get their first win this coming weekend, as they are up on the schedule next.<p></p>

            <b>NoBogies (0-2)</b> lost the <b><em>Doppelganger Rivalry</em></b> game last week, where the Uncle Rico's (1-1) got on the board with a strong win.  The <b>Uncle Rico's (1-1)</b> will be facing off against a strong opponent this weekend, against the also <b>(1-1) Momma Dubs</b>.  Momma (1-1) will look to rebound after a down performance last week, where they lost the game to their youngest little baby, <b>Shrek and Donkey! (2-0)</b> (isn't she the nicest?), and unfortunately they also lost their perennial all-star and crowd-favorite, Big Ben.  Where do they go from here?  Only Momma knows.<p></p>

            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/9AJ8o5xgwpWE9v3Bhe/giphy.gif" style="margin:auto; display:block;">
            <p></p>

            Speaking of Mommas in the house, in the <b><em>MOM vs. (almost) Mom Rivalry game</em></b>, established Momma, <b>Madi Moose (1-1)</b>, got their first win of the season, knocking off (very close to being) <b>Almost Mama! (1-1)</b>.  Madi Moose (1-1) will look to keep the win boat chuggin' along this week in the <b><em>In-House Battle #1</em></b>! against their hubby, <b>AndiRoos!! (1-1)</b>.. things will be tense in North Carolina, I can tell ya that.  Somewhere else where tensions will be high will be in ole' Philadelphia, where <b><em>In-House Battle #2</em></b>! will be taking place, where <b>Almost Mama! (1-1)</b> will look to get their wins rolling again, taking on the rolling <b>Shrek and Donkey! (2-0)</b>.  Will both husbands make it through the weekend?  Let's hope for the kid(s) sake.. they do.  <em>(Looking for wins from both of us AndiRoos!)</em><p></p>

            <p></p>

            Otherwise, that about wraps it up.. so good luck again to all this weekend, and we're almost at the cozy, fall time of the year when football and hockey are back, soups and stews are on the stove, love is in the air like a crisp breeze, and the couch is the best place to be!  <em>Gotta love it</em>.<p></p>
